### Viz Guide
#### Presenting insights visually

##### The web is data viz
- We are always translating data sources for most instant and intuitive consumption
- Database queries -> HTML/CSS/JS -> rendered page -> User interaction
- Data vis is not therefore special or compartmentalized, just another viewing tool, just another word in the language or crayon in the box. 
- Benchmark of successful Viz: Continuity: i.e. There should be not intuitive discontinuity between reading and understanding visual data; it has to pass the glance test
- Viz is layout, whitespace, graphs and charts and relative size and grouping, it is complimented by natural language and other design and communication elements. It is part of a conversation between the user and their data

##### Purpose of a Viz
- instant context
- instant comparison A/B, Now/Then, Here/There, Parent/Child
- Concept of derivatives: 
  - Base data is absolute like position. 
  - Comparisons are the derivative: like velocity: what direction are things moving
  - Early Trends and predictors are like Accelleration - is the direction things are moving changing?
  
##### Draft Taxonomy:
- The sentence
- The number
- The ratio (vs.)
- The Baseline
- The Average, expected, prior
- Grouping data - when and why
- Ratios 

##### The audience
- Visual leverages powerful built-in human tools: [the Gestault of Visual Perception](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/28/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/)
- Motion is a key part of human perception, therefore animation should be carefully considered for power and relavance
- People notive differences and force patterns onto data, especially visual data. This pattern recognition - especially when there is no pattern - has to be accounted for
- The advantage of data is interaction. Not every corellation of comparison or depth of detail can be displayed simultaneously, to this large landscape must be traversed with interactive tools or by our curation.
- People are exception driven: once a pattern is recognized it becomes the baseline and changes from the baseline are now noticed readily. In our business we are looking to demonstrate inflection points, exceptional events, cheanges from baselines - these are not always clear-cut
- Noisy data is a problem with a small data set - the user will pick out patterns that are not really there in noisy data [See Dan Kahneman's Representation Heuristic and the illusion of patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic)
- Humans take judgement shortcuts and draw conclusions irrationally for the most part. We blow out of proportion edge cases and exceptions and overestimate their effects. Are predictive mechanisms are err on the side of overreaction not the latest data. We need to take this into account the same way we take into account human perception for other interface design elements
