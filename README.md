# Public DataViz Resources
Public resources for DataViz

## Overviews and Theory
- [Edward Tufte's site](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), including the 'Teaching to See' 37 minute video
- [Gestaldt Principles of Visualization at SmashingMag](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/28/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/) How do humans see imagery - how do they subconsciously preprocess groups, trends, priority, z-depth? That's what this answers - i.e. let the bvisions system do the work for you. Just look at the examples lower in the page to see what they mean
- [Joy of stats 60 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9nvLqLM9Y0) This guy is the Carl Sagan of dataviz for public consumption and understanding, focus on detecting social trends through graph animation
- [Thinking: Fast and Slow (summary)](https://erikreads.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/thinking-fast-and-slow-book-summary.pdf) Even if you present your data and numbers clearly, Humans have a habit of processing it internally that is not methodical, precise, rational, or systematic. (If it was, we would not buy lottery tickets!) Chapter 10 outlines some of the findings on how people misrepresent very large and small numbers and probabilities internally - if you want data understood in a glance rather than a good hard think, this is worth a read.
 
## Dashing Dashboards and Data Visulaizations
- [Codepen Stats](http://codepen.io/stats/) - who need graphs? Graphs are for comparisons (deltas), not absolutes

## Directories of DataViz
- [Bl.oc.ks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) site from The Boostock runs and displays his (and your) gists of D3

## Code samples and generators
- D3 Pie with animated update [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/KsFPh/) example of tie ins for jqueryUI for data changes
- Date array series generator - to make UTC timestamp series strings and arrays [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5dsb9ocj/)
