# Public DataViz Resources
Public resources for DataViz

## Practitioners
- [Edward Tufte's site](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), including the 'Teaching to See' 37 minute video
- [Mike Bostocks site](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) si the author of D3. With making a core library of the web comes a lot of domain knowledge
- [Ben Fry's site](http://benfry.com/projects/) really looks for different viz from whats out there. 
- [Joy of stats 60 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9nvLqLM9Y0) This guy is the Carl Sagan of dataviz for public consumption and understanding, focus on detecting social trends through graph animation
- [Nicholas Felton's visualizations of his personal life](http://feltron.com/) and [his tumblr](http://feltron.tumblr.com/)


## Foundations
- [Gestaldt Principles of Visualization at SmashingMag](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/28/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/) How do humans see imagery - how do they subconsciously preprocess groups, trends, priority, z-depth? That's what this answers - i.e. let the bvisions system do the work for you. Just look at the examples lower in the page to see what they mean
- [Thinking: Fast and Slow (summary)](https://erikreads.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/thinking-fast-and-slow-book-summary.pdf) Even if you present your data and numbers clearly, Humans have a habit of processing it internally that is not methodical, precise, rational, or systematic. (If it was, we would not buy lottery tickets!) Chapter 10 outlines some of the findings on how people misrepresent very large and small numbers and probabilities internally - if you want data understood in a glance rather than a good hard think, this is worth a read.

## Quick reads
- [Slideshare on chart choosing and Best Practices](http://www.slideshare.net/idigdata/data-visualization-best-practices-2013) by Microsoftian: 
- [New York Times on Infographics](http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/reader-idea-from-article-to-infographic-translating-information-about-sneakerheads/?_r=0) This specific case study follows how their infographic team goes from idea to visualization in coordination with students. Great to understand the internal process of delivering a world class viz product that works with the audience
- [Tableau's Library of Whitepapers](http://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers) (requires Tableau Account) A collection of Top-X trends and practices.
- [Stats Can "Using Utilization" page](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/edu/power-pouvoir/ch9/using-utilisation/5214829-eng.htm) - skip to the Four Guidelines
 
## Live Examples of the Craft
- [Codepen Stats](http://codepen.io/stats/) - who need graphs? Graphs are for comparisons (deltas), not absolutes
- [Bl.oc.ks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) site from The Boostock runs and displays his (and your) gists of D3
- [Collected Gallery of d3 viz](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) some over the top stuff here
## Code samples and generators
- D3 Pie with animated update [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/KsFPh/) example of tie ins for jqueryUI for data changes
- Date array series generator - to make UTC timestamp series strings and arrays [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5dsb9ocj/)

## Insights into data
- [Cameron Davidson Pilon's Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/) If you just need the idea of the kinds of probability and uncertainty there are in data, read the introduction
- [Data Origami](http://dataorigami.net/) - CDP's Data analysis screencasts
