# Public DataViz Resources
Public resources for DataViz

## Overviews and Theory
- [Edward Tufte's site](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), including the 'Teaching to See' 37 minute video
- [Gestaldt Principles of Visualization at SmashingMag](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/28/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/) How do humans see imagery - how do they subconsciously preprocess groups, trends, priority, z-depth? That's what this answers - i.e. let the bvisions system do the work for you. Just look at the examples lower in the page to see what they mean
 
## Dashing Dashboards and Data Visulaizations
- [Codepen Stats](http://codepen.io/stats/) - who need graphs? Graphs are for comparisons (deltas), not absolutes

## Directories of DataViz
- [Bl.oc.ks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) site from The Boostock runs and displays his (and your) gists of D3

## Code samples and generators
- D3 Pie with animated update [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/KsFPh/) example of tie ins for jqueryUI for data changes
- Date array series generator - to make UTC timestamp series strings and arrays [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5dsb9ocj/)
